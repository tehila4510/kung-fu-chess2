# Kung Fu Chess — Agent Instructions

> **Cursor:** Primary instructions live in [`.cursor/rules/agents.mdc`](.cursor/rules/agents.mdc) (`alwaysApply: true`).
> Cursor Agent loads that rule automatically — keep both files in sync when editing.

C++17 console game that reads board setup and commands from stdin.

> Legacy `Board.h`/`Board.cpp`, `Game.h`/`Game.cpp`, and `MoveRules.h`/`MoveRules.cpp`
> have been removed. `src/main.cpp` is the composition root; it constructs the concrete `ScriptParser`
> (an `IScriptSource`) and `BoardPrinter` (an `IBoardPrinter`), injects them into `ScriptRunner` by const
> reference, then calls `ScriptRunner::run(std::cin, std::cout)`, which parses the `Board:`/`Commands:`
> protocol and replays it against the `model/rules/realtime/engine/input/io` layers.
> `src/server_main.cpp` hosts the WebSocket server (`ConnectionRegistry` + `MatchCoordinator`/`MatchQueue` → `RoomManager`/`MatchRoom` → `GameSession` + `EventBus` over existing `GameEngine`).
> Clients `AUTH username password`, then `PLAY` to enter ELO±100 matchmaking (60s timeout → `match_not_found`).
> A match creates a `MatchRoom` with seats W/B (earlier waiter = White). Multiple concurrent matches are supported.
> `Viewer` state exists for non-play connections (full spectator/Rooms broadcast still TODO).
> Users/ratings in SQLite via `AuthController` → `UserService` → `UserRepository`;
> per-match `RatingSubscriber` applies ELO on `GameEnded` through `UserService`.
> `SoundSubscriber` plays WAV cues from `assets/sounds/` (`select`, `deselect`, `move`, `jump`, `capture`, `promote`, `game_end`, `game_start`).
> Graphics draws a centered **GAME OVER** banner when `GameSnapshot::gameOver` is true, and White/Black side panels list moves (piece, from-to, game-clock time) and capture `SCORE` (material: P1 N/B3 R5 Q9) via `MoveHistorySubscriber`. `GameEvent::timeMs` is stamped from `GameEngine::elapsedMs()` in the graphics app only.

## Build & verify

```powershell
.\build.bat        # build and run the app (src/main.cpp composition root)
.\build.bat test   # build and run the engine test suite (includes STL graphics tests)
.\build.bat graphics  # animated board window (OpenCV via Img only; requires MSVC + OpenCV_451)
.\build.bat graphics-test  # OpenCV graphics unit tests (Animation/Cache/PieceVisual/Img/Renderer)
.\build.bat server # WebSocket server on :9002 (clone third_party deps first — see README)
```

`build.bat graphics` builds `src/graphics_main.cpp` — a thin entry point that loads
`assets/pieces/board.csv` + `assets/board.png`, constructs `GraphicsApplication`, and calls `run()`.
`GraphicsApplication` owns the engine/input wiring, `PieceVisual` state animations, delta-time loop,
and rendering. The window closes on ESC/Q or when the user closes it.

`build.bat test` also covers OpenCV-free graphics helpers (`BoardLayout`, `FileConfigSource`,
`AssetPaths`). `build.bat graphics-test` builds `KungFuChessGraphicsTests.exe` with MSVC + OpenCV
and exercises animation playback, cache DI, `PieceVisual` fallbacks, `Img`, `Renderer`, and
`FileFrameSource` against real assets under `assets/`.

Compiler flags: `-std=c++17 -Iinclude -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`

## Graphics dependencies

- Engine, console app, and tests: **STL only** — no third-party libraries
- Graphics: use the Qama Tech `Img` wrapper (`include/view/Img.h`, `src/view/Img.cpp`) from the course repo
- OpenCV (`OpenCV_451`) is allowed **only** inside `Img.h` / `Img.cpp` — never `#include <opencv2/...>` elsewhere
- No other graphics or rendering libraries (SDL, SFML, GLFW, etc.); all graphics code goes through the `Img` API
- `graphics/` (animation + asset loading) and `Renderer` depend on `Img` only; they never touch OpenCV types directly

## Architecture

Dependencies point inward only:

```
main/App → input/view/io → engine → rules/realtime → model
server_main → server/protocol/bus/auth → engine → rules/realtime → model
```

| Layer | Key types | Responsibility |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Model | `Board`, `Piece`, `Position`, `GameState` | Grid data, bounds, cell access — no I/O or rules |
| Rules | `IPieceRules`, `RuleEngine` | Per-piece move legality via Strategy pattern |
| Realtime | `Motion`, `RealTimeArbiter` | Timed movement, arrival and capture resolution |
| Engine | `GameEngine` | Orchestrates model + rules + realtime; exposes `MoveResult`, `GameSnapshot` |
| I/O | `BoardParser`, `BoardPrinter` | Parse and serialize board text |
| Input | `Controller`, `BoardMapper` | Map clicks/pixels to engine calls |
| Bus | `EventBus`, `GameEvent`, subscribers | Observer pub/sub for score/log/sound/UI/rating (`MoveMade`, `JumpMade`, `PieceCaptured`, `PiecePromoted`, `PieceSelected`, `SelectionCleared`, `GameEnded`, `ScoreUpdated`, …); graphics uses `MoveHistorySubscriber` for side-panel lines + SCORE; server uses `RatingSubscriber` for ELO; `capturePoints()` maps captured piece → material |
| Protocol | `CommandParser`, `StateSerializer`, `Algebraic` | Wire text/JSON ↔ engine calls; AUTH JSON helpers |
| Auth | `AuthController`, `UserService`, `UserRepository`, `PasswordHasher`, `Elo` | AUTH wire → service → SQLite; bcrypt hashes + ELO (server only) |
| Server | `GameSession`, `MatchRoom`, `MatchQueue`, `ConnectionRegistry`, `MatchCoordinator`, `RoomManager`, `WebSocketServer` | Network host; AUTH → PLAY; thin `WebSocketServer` dispatches to registry + matchmaking + rooms; `MatchQueue` (ELO±100, 60s); multi-match; auto-tick |
| Graphics | `Animation`, `AnimationCache`, `AnimationLoader`, `BoardLayout`, `PieceVisual` | Load/scale sprites, play named state animations, read asset layout — depends on `Img` only |
| View | `Img`, `Renderer` | `Img` wraps OpenCV (`create`, text, blit); `Renderer` composites sprites + optional White/Black history HUD — never mutate `Board` |
| Text tests | `ScriptParser`, `ScriptRunner` | Scripted stdin integration |
| App | `App`, `GraphicsApplication`, `main`, `graphics_main`, `server_main` | Wire layers; console, graphics, and server entry points |

### Cross-boundary DTOs

- `MoveValidation` — rule check result (`is_valid`, `reason`)
- `MoveResult` / `MoveOutcome` — engine accept/reject (`is_accepted`, `reason`)
- `GameSnapshot` — read-only board + state for view
- `ArrivalEvent` — piece landing and capture info from arbiter
- `MotionView` — in-flight piece for view (`piece`, `from`, `to`, `progress`)
- `RestView` — post-arrival cooldown for view (`piece`, `at`, `kind`, `remaining`)

## Input format

1. Board rows until `Board:` marker (tokens like `.`, `wK`, `bQ`)
2. `Commands:` section — `click X Y`, `jump X Y`, `wait MS`, `print board`

Errors go to stdout (e.g. `ERROR UNKNOWN_TOKEN`, `ERROR ROW_WIDTH_MISMATCH`).

`jump X Y` lifts the piece at that cell airborne in place (no destination — it always returns to the same
square) for a fixed jump duration, bypassing normal per-cell travel time. It lands back down and captures
whatever occupies the square at that point (an enemy that moved in while it was airborne); it is rejected
if the cell is empty, that color already has a motion in flight, or the piece is resting.

After any landing the piece rests before it can move or jump again: **long rest** after travel,
**short rest** after jump (`piece_resting`). Graphics plays `long_rest` / `short_rest` sprites and a
diminishing yellow (long) or blue (short) cell overlay.

## Language

- All code comments, error strings, and reason codes must be in **English**
- Never write Hebrew comments in source files

## Header vs implementation (strict)

- `.h` files are **headers only**: include guards, includes, declarations, `static constexpr` constants, and defaulted special members (`= default`)
- `.cpp` files hold **all implementations** — every function and method body lives in the matching source file, never inline in the header

## Maps over switches

- Prefer `std::unordered_map` for extensible key→value tables (piece kind → rules / capture points / display names, event type → sound cue, etc.)
- Follow the `RuleEngine` pattern: register entries in a map and look up with `find`
- Reserve `switch` for small closed enum→string helpers only (e.g. `toString(GameEventType)`)

## Exception handling (throw up, catch at boundaries)

**Goal:** validate early, throw from inner layers, catch only where errors must be translated or recovered — never log-and-rethrow the same exception at every layer.

```
model / realtime / view(Img)  →  throw only (no try-catch)
         ↓ propagates
rules / engine / input        →  catch & translate to DTO status codes
         ↓ propagates (unexpected)
ScriptRunner / main           →  single catch + log + graceful exit
```

### Model & low-level layers — validation only

Applies to: `model/`, `realtime/`, low-level helpers (`BoardMapper` constructor, `Img`).

- Perform defensive checks; **throw** from `<stdexcept>` when preconditions fail:
  - `std::invalid_argument` — bad arguments, malformed tokens, inconsistent state
  - `std::out_of_range` — grid/cell bounds, invalid coordinates
  - `std::runtime_error` — I/O preconditions (e.g. unreadable stream, missing image)
- **Do not** wrap throws in try-catch here. Let exceptions propagate upward.
- **Do not** log in model/low-level code.

### No redundant catch-and-rethrow

- **Never** add `try { … } catch (const std::exception& e) { std::cerr << …; throw; }` unless local cleanup is required (RAII should handle resources).
- One exception → one log line, at the top boundary only.

### Boundary catchers — translate, don't rethrow

| Layer | Catch when | Return / action |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| `RuleEngine::validateMove` | `Piece::fromToken` or board access fails | `MoveValidation{ false, "invalid_piece" }` |
| `PieceRules` (`pieceAt`) | token parse fails | `std::nullopt` → `isValidMove` returns `false` |
| `GameEngine::requestMove` / `requestJump` | unexpected runtime error | `MoveResult{ false, "runtime_error" }` |
| `Controller::click` / `jump` | unexpected error during input handling | `ClickResult` / `MoveResult` with `runtime_error` |
| `BoardParser` | — | prefer `BoardParseStatus` enum; throw only for unreadable streams |
| `ScriptRunner::run` | any uncaught `std::exception` | log once to `stderr`, print `ERROR RUNTIME_FAILURE` to stdout, return `false` |
| `main` / `graphics_main` | startup or top-level failure | log once, non-zero exit |

`GameEngine::wait` and `setup` **propagate** exceptions — `ScriptRunner` is the recovery boundary.

### Keep it simple

- No try-catch on operations that cannot realistically fail: `toString()`, basic integer math, trivial getters.
- Catch by `const std::exception&` at boundaries; do not catch `...` unless rethrowing immediately.
- Prefer `#include <stdexcept>` over custom exception types.

## When changing code

- If a change affects layout, architecture, layers, build setup, input protocol, or project conventions — update the instruction files accordingly:
  - `.cursor/rules/agents.mdc` (primary for Cursor)
  - `AGENTS.md` (keep in sync with agents.mdc)
  - Relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` layer files as needed
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the requested task
- Place logic in the correct layer — not in `main`
- Match naming: PascalCase classes, camelCase methods
- Register piece rules by kind in the `RuleEngine` constructor map — no piece-specific branches in `validateMove`
- Prefer `std::unordered_map` over `switch` for other extensible lookups (capture points, piece names, sound cues); `switch` only for small closed enum→string helpers
- Do not add external libraries to the engine/console/tests — STL only there
- Graphics: Qama Tech `Img` only; OpenCV confined to `Img.h` / `Img.cpp` — remove any other graphics libs immediately
- Do not commit `build/` artifacts unless explicitly asked
- Register new `.cpp` files in both `build.bat` and `CMakeLists.txt`
- Do not change the stdin command protocol without explicit request
